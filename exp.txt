For the data file the first long set of numbers they are all Hourly Atmospheric Pressure readings in "mb". When the 'n' shows up that marks a new set of data which relates to Hourly Air Temperature in Deg C. The HTML file has a lot more data in it I just have not added yet. The hourly part isn't too important I just ran a report and did hourly so I did not have to run a report over a long span of time. Finally the "44027" and "WEXM1" in the HTML file at the top is just the name of the buoys I had it run a report for ignore those and just worry about what it is reading in and the unit of measurement.
