## Data Analysis and Record Tool (DART)

Welcome to our GitHub page!

This is a semester long project we are undertaking for a class at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio.
This goal is to design a windows application that helps the user interpret the data read from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoys.

The course instructors are:
- Dr. Chang Liu
- Yiran Liu

The students involved in this project are:
- Prachetas Deshpande
- Jack Mullen
- Dylan Rogers
- Josh Wright

## Prerequisites

- .NET 4.6.1 framework

- Visual Studio

- Python 3 installed and added to PATH

- Windows capable of running Visual Studio

- Knowledge of Visual Studio (not required but helpful)

## Installation
- Clone the GitHub code
- Open the [project](VisualStudio/NOAA_Monitor/NOAA_Monitor.sln)
- Under the Debug tab click the Start Debugging

## Possible Errors
If the buoylist class function load says that the file location cannot be found:
- Go to the [Bin](VisualStudio/NOAA_Monitor/VSProjectFiles/bin/Debug) file and put in the directory to the most recent .txt file

If the run_cmd function errors saying invalid parameters for the Process.Start function there is an issue with your python3 installation.
- Make sure that python3 is in your PATH
